 * central Executor, as soon as it gets a Runnable added. When more runnables
 * are added, they go to a queue, if there is already a job active. When the job
 * finishes, it checks if there are more runnables, and the limit is not
 * reached, and processes them immediately. Otherwise it creates a new job, and
 * enqueues it to the central executor, giving possible other Processors
 * processing time. If there are no Runnables, the processor does not use any
